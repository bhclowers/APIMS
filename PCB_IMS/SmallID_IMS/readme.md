### When coupled with thinner pcb spacers, these electrodes can be used to generate highly uniform field in a fashion similary to the original manuscript by Reinecke and Clowers.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067218300294
### For a detailed assessment, please note that the spacing and pitch ratios of electrodes is based upon the work by Bohnhorst et al. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12127-016-0202-7
