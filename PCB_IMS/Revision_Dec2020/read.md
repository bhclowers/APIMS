## Updated design files currently used in the lab. 

### We have found it useful to print out teflon spacers (usually out of 0.005" teflon from McMaster) and incorporate them into the assembly.  These help seal the chamber (yes, we've dunked an IMS like a bicycle tire) and ensure there are no leaks. For more details in this regard please see: http://www.clowersresearch.com/main/open-source-ims-initiative/

### Additionally, it is important to know that each board manufacturer will make boards with differing thickness tolerances.  It is for this reason that stacking 30 rings and spacers together may yield a scenario where the slots for the DC coupler do not align exactly.  If that is the case you may need to manually adjust the DC coupler file to make it fit to your specific board run.  Our iterative approach when ordering a large new batch of electrodes is to assemble a stack, test out the old DC coupler, and then adjust that coupler if needed and reorder.
